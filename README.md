# Golang learning
## Points
- Go provides the best of both worlds, by striking a balance between dynamic and statically compiled languages. 
  - strong and staticly typed.
- Fast compile time
- Garbage collected
- Built-in concurrency
- Compile to standalone binaries. (All compiled code in one file.)

NOTE - Go send error if declared variable is not use.
